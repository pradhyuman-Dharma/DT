In Ubuntu, you may wish to consider not using PuTTY at all: you can simply ssh using a terminal. For example, if you want to connect to test.server.com, you could simply type:


ssh test.server.com 


If your username is different on the remote system, you can specify it by using this syntax:

ssh remote_username@remote_host
